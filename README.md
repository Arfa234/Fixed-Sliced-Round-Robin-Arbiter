# Fixed-Sliced-Round-Robin-Arbiter

This project involves the design and implementation of a Verilog-based Round-Robin Arbiter, an essential
component in VLSIsystems. The arbiter serves to distribute resources among requesters by rotating access,
responding to active requests, and skipping inactive ones. This dynamic resource management ensures that
each active requester receives fair treatment without unnecessary delays or resource wastage. The resulting
design was verified using simulation to confirm that it meets the desired specifications for fair and efficient
resource allocation.
